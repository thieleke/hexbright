Switch between brightnesses if pressed and released within 250 milliseconds (1/4 second).

If held for longer than that, go to strobe (15 hz or so, right where it's uncomfortable). 

Upon release of strobe, go to the previous light state.  Code to just shutdown after it is included, but commented out.
