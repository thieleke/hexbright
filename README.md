hexbright_jrt by Jeff Thieleke

Significant changes from hexbright_factory (default factory code):
  * Incorporated accelerometer, 15 minute no-motion power off, and 2 second delay->power switch->power off  
     shortcut code from https://github.com/bhimoff/HexBrightFLEX
  * Modified the duty cycle on the blinking mode to be more bicycle friendly
  * Added a last-on memory (including for the blinking light level)
  * Code reformatting and reorganization

  
There are two functionally similar sketches:
  * programs/hexbright_jrt        (uses dhiltonp's hexbright library)
  * programs/hexbright_jrt_nonlib (non-library version)

If you are looking to modify one of these sketches, I would start with the library version
since it is cleaner and builds upon the excellent hexbright library.  If sketch size and
(potentially) free RAM is more important, the non-library version would be a better choice.

hexbright
=========

This is the easiest way to get started with programming your hexbright.

---

1.  Download and install [arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and the CP210x driver (Use a VCP Driver Kit from [here](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)).  Most linux kernels come with the driver pre-built.

2.  Download this folder using one of these methods, accessible at the top of the [project page](https://github.com/dhiltonp/hexbright).
    *   **Clone in Windows/Mac** This is an easy way to keep an up-to-date version of the code.
    *   **ZIP** Extremely easy to get started, but you will need to manually update the project.
    *   **git clone git@github.com:dhiltonp/hexbright.git** Command line, read-only access.
    *   **Fork** Click fork to generate your own copy of the project if at some point you will want to submit or share your code.

3.  Open the arduino ide, and click on 'File'->'Preferences' in the menu.

4.  Set your sketchbook location to the location of this folder (where this README file is found).

5.  Restart arduino.

6.  In arduino, click on 'Tools'->'Board'->'Hexbright' as your device type.

7.  With your hexbright unplugged, go to 'Tools'->'Serial Port' and look at the options.

8.  Now plug in your hexbright and go to 'Tools'->'Serial Port'.  Select the new option.  (On linux, there may be a delay of over a minute before the device appears.)

9.  Underneath the 'Sketch' and 'Tools' menu options, there is an up arrow (to open a program).  Click on it, go to 'programs', and select a program.

---

*   'temperature_calibration' is one of the simplest programs you could write.

*   'functional' is a basic example of how a program might have multiple modes.

*   'down_light' contains an example of using the accelerometer.

*   libraries/hexbright/hexbright.h has a list of all available methods in the api, and is fairly well commented.


I have translated most of the original sample programs to the library here: https://github.com/dhiltonp/samples

Be aware that this library is a work in progress.  In particular, the accelerometer api may change, and it is not yet optimized.

Enjoy!
